## Project Background
As a data analyst for Surge Telecoms (ST), I was tasked with producing a high-level dashboard to visualize the company's churn report for Q4 2024. **This dashboard uses approximately 7,000 synthetic records of telecom customers, including monthly charges, contract types, and tenure in months.** The main objective was to improve company "stickiness" and optimize future business operations by analyzing the statistics of churned clients—such as how many left and their reasons for doing so. Key areas of focus included churn reasons, churn categories, and accepted offers.

Above is a screenshot of the Tableau dashboard and more examples are linked in the report. The link to the full dashboard can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neal.alday/viz/PlanetTelecomsChurn/ChurnReportQ2)

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides an at-a-glance view of Surge Telecom's customer retention performance over the previous quarter. Out of 7,043 unique customers, 1,869 left the company, with the majority citing better competitor services and poor customer support as their primary reasons. The overall churn rate stands at 27%, while 50% of high-risk customers are at risk of churning. Clients with month-to-month contracts are the most vulnerable to churn, highlighting the need for incentives to transition them into longer-term contracts. While retention initiatives can be adjusted, historical data suggests they are not a major factor in customers choosing to stay.

## Insights Deep-Dive
**Customer Status**
- **1,869 customers churned out of 7,043**, resulting in a churn rate of 27%.
- The company retained 4,760 customers (67%), while 454 (6%) recently joined.
- Churn rate has decreased by 2.7% from last quarter, but a **more aggressive strategy is needed** to further reduce this number.

**Customer Churn Risk**
- Customers are categorised as high, medium or low risk clients: 50% of staying high risk customers have an elevated probability of churning and **extreme steps should be taken to retain them**.
- Meanwhile, 82% of staying customers are classified as medium risk and should be monitored intensively.
- Risk assessment calculation is based off a monthly charge x tenure in months split depending on customer category.

**Tenure of Churned Customers**
- Clients on month-to-month contracts have the **highest likelihood of churning**.
- The majority of churned clients stayed with the company for **less than six months**, indicating early dissatisfaction.
- Customers who have been with ST for **more than two years are also observed to churn**, suggesting a lack of long-term retention incentives.

**Retention Initiatives**
- Among churned customers, only 23% accepted a freebies offer, indicating that **this incentive is ineffective and should be improved**.
- **The most successful retention offer for staying customers was the phone bundle**.
- Since offers aren’t a major factor in retention, **funds could potentially be reallocated to other areas**.

## Recommendations
**Customer Churn Risk Profile**
- A stronger retention strategy is needed for the remaining 49% of high-risk customers.
- The 82% of medium-risk staying customers should be actively monitored for signs of churn.

**Retention Initiatives**
- Encourage monthly customers to switch to quarterly or bi-annual contracts by offering targeted incentives.
- Continue and expand the phone bundle program, prioritizing high-risk customers.

**Service Improvements**
- Intensify marketing efforts to improve discoverability of current offers and device options.
- Liaison with the customer service department to improve technical support.
- Maintain the current pricing structure, as it is not a significant driver of churn.
