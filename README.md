# Surge Telecoms Churn Report 2025

## Project Background
As a data analyst for Surge Telecoms (ST), I was tasked with producing a high-level dashboard to visualise the company's churn report for Q4 of 2024. **This dashboard uses approximately 7k synthetic records of telecom customers such as monthly charge, contract type, and tenure in months.** The main objective was to improve company "stickiness" and optimise future business operations by looking at the statistics of churned clients e.g. how many clients have left and what was their reason for leaving. Key areas that were focused on included churn reason, churn category, and accepted offers.

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides an at-a-glance view of Surge Telecom's performance in terms of customer retention from the previous quarter. From 7,043 unique customers, about 1,869 left the company, with the majority citing better competitor services and poor customer support as their main reasons. Churn rate stands at 27%, while 50% of high risk customers are in danger of following suit. Clients holding month-to-month contracts are most at risk of churning and incentives to lock them in longer contracts should be provided. Retention initiatives can also be reaadjusted, although it is historically observed that it is not a major reason for staying. 

## Insights Deep-Dive
**Customer Status**
- **1,869 customers have churned out of 7,043**, producing a churn rate of 27%.
- The company retained 4,760 (67%) clients, while 454 (6%) recently joined.
- Churn rate is down 2.7% from last quarter, but **a more aggressive strategy should be implemented** to further reduce this number.

**Top Reasons for Churn**
- Better competitor devices and services were cited as the top reason for churned customers.
- Poor technical support and dissatisfaction with network services take up the second and third spot, respectively.
- It is worth noting that the attitude of the customer service representative was a strong driver for customers to switch networks.
- Pricing structure is mentioned as the least important reason for churn, indicating that customers are generally satisfied in this area.

**Customer Churn Risk**
- Customers are categorised as high, medium or low risk clients: 50% of staying high risk customers have an elevated probability of churning and extreme steps should be taken to retain them.
- Meanwhile, 82% of staying customers are classified as medium risk and should be monitored intensively.
- Risk assessment calculation is based off a monthly charge x tenure in months split depending on customer category.

**Tenure of Churned Customers**
- Clients holding a month-to-month contract have been proven to have the highest probability of churn.
- Majority of churned clients stayed with the company for less than six months, signifying that they were not fully satisfied with their experience.
- Customers who have been with ST for more than two years are also observed to churn, denoting a gap in the company's incentives for long-time consumers to stay.

**Retention Initiatives**
- Among churned customers, 23% accepted a freebies offer, implying that this offer is unsatisfactory and should be improved.
- The top offer for staying customers is the phone bundle.
- With that said, offers aren't a major sticky point and funding can potentially be diverted.

## Recommendations
**Customer Churn Risk Profile**
- A more robust retention initiative should be pursued for the remaining 49% of high risk customers.
- Majority of medium risk staying customers (82%) should be monitored for churn.

**Retention Initiatives**
- Incentives should be provided to move monthly customers to a quarterly or bi-annual contract.
- The phone bundle program should be continued and the company should provide this offer to more high risk customers. 

**Service Improvements**
-  Intensify marketing efforts to improve discoverability of current offers and device lineup.
-  Liaison with the customer service department to improve technical support.
-  Current pricing is effective and can be maintained.
